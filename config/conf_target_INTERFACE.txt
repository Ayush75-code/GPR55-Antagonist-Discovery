# Vina Configuration file for GPR55/G-alpha Interface
# (The Primary PPI Target - "Molecular Wedge" Site)
# Calculated from centerofmass of interface residues (5Å cutoff)
# Chain R (GPR55): 397 interface atoms
# Chain A (G-alpha): 335 interface atoms

receptor = GPR55_complex.pdbqt

# Interface Center of Mass (calculated in PyMOL)
center_x = 112.678
center_y = 92.605
center_z = 112.545

# A larger 25x25x25 Angstrom box to capture the full interface groove
size_x = 25
size_y = 25
size_z = 25

# High-quality search parameters for HTVS
exhaustiveness = 16

# Notes:
# - This target uses the HOLO-COMPLEX (full GPR55 + G-protein)
# - Ligands binding here should physically disrupt GPR55/G-alpha coupling
# - Hit Threshold: ΔG < -8.5 kcal/mol (from Phase 1 validation)
